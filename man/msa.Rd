\title{Multiple Sequence Alignment}
\usage{
msa(sequences, ids = names(sequences), seqtype = "protein", method = "Muscle", sfile = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{sequences}{vector containing the sequences as strings.}

\item{ids}{character vector containing the sequences' ids.}

\item{seqtype}{it should be either "protein" or "dna".}

\item{method}{currently, "Muscle", ClustalW", "ClustalOmega" are supported.}

\item{sfile}{if different to FALSE, then it should be a string indicating the path to save a fasta alignment file.}
}
\value{
Returns a in matrix (dataframe) format. Optionally, the fasta format of the alignment can be saved.
}
\description{
Aligns multiple protein, DNA sequences using the msa package.
}
\details{
The msa package works without requiring you to install MUSCLE or other alignment tools. The msa package includes its own precompiled binaries for MUSCLE, ClustalW, and Clustal Omega, which are used internally
}
\examples{
\dontrun{msa(sequences = c("APGW", "AGWC", "CWGA"), ids = c("a", "b", "c"))}
